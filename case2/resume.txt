People Analytics Problem:

Objective: identify ways of improving performance of the company areas and of the company as a hole. 


I want to have information for:
1. Hiring
2. Internal transferences

I will construct information about that by using:
1. Psicometric tests results
2. The person's actual area
3. The person's performance in its area


By having information about what "kind" of people (based on psicometric + performance) 
is good for each area. I can sugest:

1- what type of profile the company should give preference for each area when Hiring
2- I can look if there are profiles with bad performance in "wrong" areas for them
and suggest that internal transference could improve the performance and satisfaction
for both of them.
